Assessment Api

Description: Created a main controller (WeatherForecastController) to call 2 backend controllers (DirectionsController, WeatherController)

Used the WebApi template from Visual Studio, that is why the objects being used are related to the Weather. Updated the class to handle with JSON.

To run, open with Visual Studio and hit (ctrl + f5), this will start the program and should result in the browser opening Swagger, which the APIs can be tested there.

WeatherForecast is the main controller and excutes the 2 other API
The Get verb returns the Poll Directions List
The Post verb returns the Weather List
This was done so that results can be seen after executing the 2 APIs. Add a delay to the first API call.

Using Framework .NET 8.0
Also included Newtonsodt.Json (13.0.3) to hanlde parsing

ToDo Items:
- Use IHttpClientFactory to create and manage single instance of client to avoid deadlocks
- Handle null, which can mean rework type, return empty list, return bool and aggregate results into result and response objects
- Aggregate result
- Error handling or HTTP status codes
